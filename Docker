1. What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 
With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

2. What is docker registery?
A Docker registry stores Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry that anyone can use, and Docker looks for images on Docker Hub by default.

3. Docker contains docker deamon(responsible for all the works) and docker client. Docker desktop contain both deamon and client.
4. Docker architecture
uses client-server architecture.
The Docker client and daemon communicate using a REST API, over UNIX sockets or a network interface

5. What is docker image
An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Often, an image is based on another image, with some additional customization

6. why images are lightweight in nature?
To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image.
When you change the Dockerfile and rebuild the image, only those layers which have changed are rebuilt.

7. What is container?
A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI.

*******************************Docker commands******************************
docker container create imagename (to create container from image)

docker run -it imagename (pull the image if not already present)
docker images (show images)
docker container ls (show containers)
docker container ls -a (show all containers even the stopped one)
docker start containername
docker stop containername
docker exec -it containername bash (to attach the container with the terminal), ctrl+d to exit
docker run -it -p localport:instanceport imagename (for port mapping)
docker container prune(remove all stopped containers)

how to create a docker image?
1.create a docker file inside the project 
2. docker build -t yourimagename .
