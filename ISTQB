***************************************************************************** ISTQB Quick Bytes ****************************************************************************************

Absence-of-errors fallacy --If your software or system is unusable (or does not fulfill users' wishes) then it does not matter how many defects are found and fixed – it is still unusable.
tests wear out --f the same tests are repeated many times, they become increasingly ineffective at detecting new defects. To overcome this effect, existing tests and test data may need to be modified and new tests written.

whole team approach 
********************
the testers also work closely with developers and helps them to create the unit test cases. Testers help business representatives to create suitable acceptance tests.

Informal reviews --they are not documented.
Walkthrough: -- led by the authors/scribe,To achieve a common understanding and to gather feedback and To examine and discuss the validity of the proposed solutions.
Technical review: -- less formal review,led by the trained moderator but can also be led by a technical expert,Defects are found by the experts.
Inspection: -- most formal review type and led by the trained moderators.During inspection the documents are prepared and checked thoroughly by the reviewers before the meeting.
           -- It involves peers to examine the product

3-Points Estimating technique
*****************************
Two popular formula:

1. Triangular distribution:

Triangular Distribution: E = (o + m + p ) / 3
2. Beta Distribution (PERT): E = (o + 4m + p ) / 6
where E is Estimate; o = optimistic estimate; p = pessimistic estimate; m = most likely estimate

************************************
Agile Testing Quadrants
************************************
Quadrant 1: Technology-facing tests that support the team
Quadrant 2: Business-facing tests that support the team
Quadrant 3: Business-facing tests that critique the product
Quadrant 4: Technology-facing tests that critique the product

 Usability testing is in Q3 (1 – C)
 Component testing is in Q1 (2 – A)
 Functional testing is in Q2 (3 – B)
 Reliability testing is in Q4 (4 – D)


What is risk likelihood?
Risk likelihood is the probability or frequency that a problem will occur, given the current conditions and assumptions. It can be measured in terms of percentage, ratio, frequency, or any other numerical scale. 
The higher the likelihood, the more likely the problem is.

Configure test environments & Report on achieved coverage is mainly tester work.
In ATDD, tests are created, based on acceptance criteria to drive the development of the
related software.

shift left approach
*********************
 Early review is an example of the shift left approach.
TDD is an example of the shift left approach.
Early non-functional testing is an example of the shift left
approach.
