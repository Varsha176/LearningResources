What is service mesh

A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built into an application that controls service-to-service communication in a microservices architecture.
It controls the delivery of service requests to other services, performs load balancing, encrypts data, and discovers other services.

why do i need istio if i have load balancer?
When in-cluster services communicate, a load balancer called kube-proxy forwards requests to service pods at random. You can use Istio to add more complex load balancing methods, enabled by Envoy. 
Envoy supports multiple load balancing methods, including random, round-robin, and least request.
