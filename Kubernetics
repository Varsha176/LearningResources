1. what is docker and what is kubernatics?
ans: Docker is a container platform while kubernatics is a container orchestration platform. 
Problems with docker:--
1.1 Single Host nature
In docker there is one host on which we install docker and create containers so containers can impact ecah other.
1.2 Self healing is missing
If any container is down then application is also down and there is no way to automatically up the container in docker.
1.3 Auto scaling is missing

How Kubernatics solved these problems?
1.1 Kubernatics uses clusters (server node architecure) hence impacting container can be shifted to different node.
1.2 Auto healing is there.
1.3 Auto scaling can be done using yaml file(manually) or using HPA(hORIZONtal pod autoscaler)

Kubernetics arhicetecture

Server node == control plane and worker node == data plane.
Pods are similar to containers just have some more capabilities than containers.
worker node/data plane has 3 components:
  |----Container runtime (responsible for running the pod )
  2----Kubectl (Responsible for checking if the pod is running or not(auto-healing))
  3----kubeProxy (Responsible for assigning network to pods(like ip addresses,ports))

Servernode/Control plane components:
   1 ---core component name as 'API server' which exposes the kubernatics cluster to external world , meaning take and process all the requests.
   2 --- Cube scheduler (recieves info from API server and then schedules the pod creation on diff nodes).
   3 --- etcd -- stores entire cluster info in form of key-value pair.
   4 --- Cloud container manager (not required for on-premise cluster, only required for running kubernatics on cloud platforms like aws,azure)

Pod Vs Container
*********************************
1. Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetics. Pod can contain multiple containers.
2. Kubernetics provide ip to pod not to the containers.(Kube-proxy responsible for assigning IP to pods).
3. Containers within pods can share data volume but containers among diff pods cant share data volumes.
4. pods can not communicate with each other.
5. Kubernetcis alternative is docker-swarm.
6. Kubernetics supports auto scaling & auto healing, which is not supported by docker-swarm.
