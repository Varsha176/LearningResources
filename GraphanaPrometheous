1. What is prometheus

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring system, written in Go that collects metrics data and stores that data in a time series database.
it is a pull-based tool. It collects metrics of the target system using HTTP, stores them locally or remotely and displays them back in the Prometheus server.
Prometheus server then scrapes the metrics based on the time interval we defined and stores it in a time-series database.Prometheus.yaml file used for this.
