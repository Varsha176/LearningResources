1. What is AWS CLI?

Ans: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) helps to manage the AWS services directly from the command line. It is also used to create and manage infra.

2. What is Cloud Formation?

Ans: CloudFormation is a service that allows you to define and manage AWS infrastructure as code. You create templates using JSON or YAML syntax to describe the resources and their configurations that you want to provision on AWS.
CloudFormation templates can be created and managed through the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or SDKs.


3. How CLI is different from Cloud formation.
* One of the strong benefits of CloudFormation is the automatic support for rolling back changes if anything fails while deploying a stack.
* Updating infrastructure using CloudFormation is another benefit. Make the change in the template and update the stack.

4. What is IAC?
Infrastructure as code (IaC) is an approach to managing and provisioning computing infrastructure through machine-readable definition files.
Benefits: 
* automation reduces manual errors, increases consistency, and speeds up the deployment process.
* Version control track to changes over time, collaborate effectively and roll back to previous versions if needed.
* Reproducibility and Scalability.

5. What is the drift detection feature in Cloud formation?
CFT acts as a middleman between the user and the cloud provider. It reads the instructions from the YAML/JSON file and converts it into API Calls. If there is any change
in the configured infrastructure (intentional/accidental) then CFT can detect this drift by showing what has changed.

In cloud formation template only the resource section is mandatory.
