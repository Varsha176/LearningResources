What is a load balancer?
A load balancer is a device or service that distributes network traffic dynamically across resources—on-premises or cloud—to support an application.

Types of load balancers- 2 generic types of load balances --application layer load balancers and transport layer load balancers.
ALB (Application load balancer) is costly and there is latency involved. It intercepts your req.
NLB(Networl load balancer) --low latency, high transmission of data. Ex game server, streaming platform. It does not intercept your req
GWLB (Gateway load balancers)-- for VPN/firewalls --offers high security.

which to choose?
For applying advanced load balancing techniques use ALB, for security use GWLB, for sticky sessions use NLB.

What are sticky sessions?
sending all the info to a same server. ex streaming 5 hr long video then it should be gone to the same single server.
