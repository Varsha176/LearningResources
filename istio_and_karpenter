1. What is a service mesh??
A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer built into an application that controls service-to-service communication in a microservices architecture.
It controls the delivery of service requests to other services, performs load balancing, encrypts data, and discovers other services.

2. Kubernetes vs istio
https://thenewstack.io/why-do-you-need-istio-when-you-already-have-kubernetes/
https://tetrate.io/blog/what-is-istio-and-why-does-kubernetes-need-it/

why do I need istio if I have a load balancer?
When in-cluster services communicate, a load balancer called kube-proxy forwards requests to service pods at random. You can use Istio to add more complex load balancing methods, enabled by Envoy. 
Envoy supports multiple load balancing methods, including random, round-robin, and last request.



3 what is istio?
Istio is an open-source service mesh that enables the communication between microservices. It helps in security, traffic management and observability.

4. Istio architecture
ISTIO comprises data planes and control planes.

Istio control plane is responsible for managing envoy proxies. control-plane comprises 3 components.
1 - Pilot -- distribution routing rules and traffic configuration to the Envoy proxies.
2. Citadel -- provides the mutual TLS authentication between services.
3. Galley -- Enforces access control and collects telemetry data for monitoring.

Istio data plane consists of Envoy proxies deployed as sidecars, running alongside application instances in Kubernetes pods.
The Envoy proxies manage traffic for services on the system, including managing and controlling network communication between microservices.

5. What is Istiod?
Istiod converts high-level routing rules that control traffic behaviour into Envoy-specific configurations and propagates them to the sidecars at runtime

6. What is a gateway?

Ingress gateway-- An ingress gateway allows us to define entry points into the mesh that all incoming traffic flows through. Gateway objects are used to enable the ingress gateway to receive traffic.
Egress gateway --An egress gateway are exit point from the mesh 

7. What is envoy?
Envoy is a high-performance, open-source proxy server designed for cloud-native applications. It is often used in conjunction with service mesh platforms like Istio to provide advanced traffic management, load balancing, and observability capabilities for microservices-based applications.

1. What is Karpenter?
Karpenter is an open-source node auto scaler built for Kubernetes. Karpenter improves the efficiency and cost of running workloads on Kubernetes clusters by:
Watching for un-schedulable pods, Provisioning nodes that meet the requirements of the pods, and Removing the nodes when the nodes are no longer needed.
it automatically launches the appropriate worker node without node groups. CREATED by AWS.
Uses nodepool yaml to define info like instance type, architecture, number of chores etc.
