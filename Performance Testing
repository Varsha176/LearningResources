1. What is performance testing?
non functional type of testing that verifies the speed, stability and scalability of the application.

2. what is response time/elapsed time?
Latency + processing time 

3. what is latency time?
latency = time to first byte

4. what is connect time?

5. what is throughput?

6. what is performance thresholds?

performance testing types
1-Load testing (under expected load)
2- Stress testing ()
3- endurence testing (for stability) -- done to check if system can sustain continuous expected load for a long duration, also known as soak testing.
4- spike testing --analyse the behaviour of app under sudden/unexpected load.
5- volume testing - is performed by feedin the app with high volume of data.

1- To record a script , create a template and select recording. This template consider following things:
1.1 User defined Variables
1.2 HTTP Req Defaults like url and port
1.3 Cookie manager
1.4 Thread groups to handle multiple user load

create new test plan, add HTTP thread group by right click and add listeners and assertions (simplest way for frontend testing)

assertions -- response code, duration ,size ,HTML ,xml/json assertion. xml schema assertion

config elements are those elements which executes before the sampler requests at the same level.
