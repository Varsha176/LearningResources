1. What is performance testing?
non functional type of testing that verifies the speed, stability and scalability of the application.

2. what is response time/elapsed time?
Latency + processing time 

3. what is latency time?

4. what is connect time?

5. what is throughput?

6. what is performance thresholds?

performance testing types
1-Load testing (under expected load)
2- Stress testing ()
3- endurence testing (for stability) -- done to check if system can sustain continuous expected load for a long duration, also known as soak testing.
4- spike testing --analyse the behaviour of app under sudden/unexpected load.
5- volume testing - is performed by feedin the app with high volume of data.
