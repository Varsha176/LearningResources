4. What are IAM Roles?
-IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities you trust.Roles are not associated with specific users or groups; instead, they are assumed by entities when needed.

-Temporary Permissions: Roles are often used to grant temporary permissions to entities. For example, an AWS Lambda function might assume a role to access other AWS services for a limited time during execution.
-Cross-Account Access: Roles can be used to grant access across AWS accounts. This is useful for scenarios where resources in one account need to interact with resources in another account.
-Federation: Roles can be used for federated access, allowing users who are authenticated by an external identity provider (such as Active Directory or an OAuth provider) to assume roles in AWS.
-Trust Policies: Roles have trust policies attached to them, which define which entities are allowed to assume the role.
